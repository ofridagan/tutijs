/*
 * ------- Chapter Goals ------------------
 * Javascript is a language, its sentances are called "statements"
 * Time: 8 minutes
 * ----------------------------------------
 */

/*
 * Much like sentances in a human-language, the building blocks of JS are called statements.
 * Every program in JS is just a list of those statements, sometimes called 'instructions'.
 *
 * A few statements may also be grouped together into bigger constructs like blocks, if's, loops, and function - which we'll learn all about in next chapters.
 * To continue the humman-language analogy, these groups of statements could be thought of something like paragraphs.
 */

/*
 * Before continuing, please do me a favor and comment-out line number 2 of this file to enable it.
 * Optionaly you can also uncomment line number 2 of the previous chapter to disable it, and get a cleaner output in the browser.
 */

/*
 * Ah much better. Thanks! Now we can proceed.
 * The following line contains one example statement. Uncomment it, save the file and check out the browser.
 */

/* shows a greeting message */
//alert("Hello world!!!");

/* 
 * Did you see the message? good. You can re-comment the line.. these alerts can get pretty annoying.
 * You probably guessed the meaning of this statement already - it instructs the browser to show an alert message with a specified text.
 *
 * A semicolon (;) is used at the end of a statement to mark exactly where the statement ends.
 * It's worth noting that in most cases JS can figure out where a statement ends even without the semicolon, so it's not mandatory.
 * However it can sometimes cause ambiguity in interpreting your code, which can make JS complain.
 * Hence, it is consider best practice to always start a statement in a new line, and end a it with a semicolon (;).
 */

/*
 * The following line contains two statements.
 * As usual, un-comment it and see what it does.
 * Then, rewrite it to confirm to the best practice described above (each statement in its own line, and a semicolon at the end of each).
 */

/* two statements */
//const who = "world";export const greating = "Hello " + who + "!!!"

/*
 * Great. You can move on to the next chapter!
 */

/*
 * %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 * Congradulations!!! You've reached the end of the second chapter.
 * Don't worry, the good stuff are comming. We just need to power through those boring bits first. Another coffee maybe?
 * %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 */

/*
 * ----- What did I learn? ----------
 * Statements are the smallest peices of code that have meaning. i.e something that JS understands.
