/*
 * ------- Chapter Goals ------------------
 * Get to know the tuti.js platform.
 * Time: 10 minutes
 * ----------------------------------------
 * 
 * Asumming you already followed the instructions in the README.md file,
 * you should now have a browser open and should be able to see the title of this chapter.
 * If not try to follow the README file again, or call fiki :)

/*
 * OK, then. You are all set, and ready to learn javascript!
 * The way to use this tutorial is to go through the files under the chapters/ folder, in order.
 * Each file contains instructions, some theory, links to reading materials and assignments.
 *
 * Let's start by looking around this file.
 * But to help you out a bit, let me tell you about Comments.
 *
 * Comments are lines of code, which are meant to be ignored. In fact javascript deleted, those lines before running your program.
 * Comments are meant to be read by hummans. They are suppose to shine light on the more complex parts of your code and help others (or future you)
 * decipher the ideas or logic behind a particular piece code.
 *
 * TIP: you should always prefer a simple and readable code with little or no comments, to code which is complex but well commented.
 *
 * JS (javascript) allows us to add comments in two different ways:
 * 1. single-line comments are written as // and than your comment (see line 2 in this file, for example).
 * 2. multiple-line comment are written with an openning /* then your comments, then a closing */

/*
 * For the purpose of this tutorial I will always use multiple-line comments for instructions - make sure to leave those commented.
 * Single-line comments are used for code that you can uncommented and play with.
*/

/*
 * Currently, this file includes exactly one, uncommented line - the first line (which tells tuti.js about the name of this chapter).
 * Let's change that, shell we?
 *
 * Try to uncomment all the single-line comments bellow (delete the //'s):
 */

/* just a string value */
//export const first = "I Love You";

/* a function with no arguments the just return value */
//export const second = () => "Tuti";

/* a function with a body */
//export const third = () => {
//    const fiveVery = [1,2,3,4,5].map(() => "Very");
//    return fiveVery.join(" ") + " Muchy";
//}

/*
 * Did you do it? Great!
 * Now save the file, and take a look at the browser. You should be able to see 3 boxes with some text in them.
 *
 * See it? Awesome!
 *
 * Try to play a bit with the code above. Change the text to some other message you would like to see.

/*
 * %%%%%%%% The End %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 * Congradulations!!! You've reached the end of the first chapter.
 * Treat yourself to a cup of coffee :)

/*
 * ----- What did I learn? ----------
 * You learned how to use tuti.js
 * You now know how to start it, locate the chapters files, edit them, and view your work in the browser.
 * As a bonus, you also learned about comments in JS and the two available formats.

/*
 * ######### Bonus ##################
 * The keyword 'export' in JS is used to allow a value from one file (also called module) to be accessed from other files (or modules).
 * Every value you export from this file (or from other chapters) will be displayed on the browser-page automatically!
 * If you export a function it will get run and the returned value will be displayed.
