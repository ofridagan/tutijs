# Tuti.JS!

Hi!
This is a nice little environment for Tuti to learn JS with ease.
The idea is to provide a quick way to write some code and see the result.


## Installation	

**install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** - if not already installed

**Clone this repository**

    cd ~/
    git clone git@github.com:ofridagan/tutijs.git

**install dependencies**

	cd tutijs
    sudo npm install

## Running

**Running development server**
The development server runs on your machine and serves the project your are about to write

    npm run start
  Your default browser should open at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and you should see the app there

## What next?

Open your favorite text editor and open the file **./src/tuti.js**, edit it, and the changes should reflect in the browser.
If your changes don't show **Watch out for errors where you run the server**.
