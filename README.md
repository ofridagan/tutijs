# Tuti.JS!

Welcome to the tuti.js platform!
This is a nice little environment for Tuti to learn JS with ease.
The idea is to provide a quick way to write some code and see the result.
Play with, have fun!


## Installation	

**install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** - if not already installed

**Clone this repository**

    cd ~/
    git clone git@github.com:ofridagan/tutijs.git

**install dependencies**

	cd tutijs
    sudo npm install

## Running

**Running development server**
The development server runs on your machine and serves the project your are about to write

    npm run start
  Your default browser should open at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and you should see the app there

## What's next?

Open your favorite text editor (try [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), locate the first chapter at **src/chapters/1_intro.js**.
Follow the instruction there.

### Good Luck <3 ###
