# Tuti.JS!

Welcome to the tuti.js platform!
This is a nice little environment for Tuti to learn Javascript with ease.
The idea is to provide a quick way to write some code and see the result.

Play with it, have fun!


## Installation	

### Get you environment ready
The first thing we need to do is make sure you have all the tools needed to be a JS developer.
This can take some time the first time you do it... even a few hours.

**choose a text editor** I think [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a nice one.

**install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** - if not already installed.
You can check if node.js is installed by running:

    node --version

**setup your [git]([https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git#setting-up-git](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git#setting-up-git))**


### Get tuti.js
**Clone this repository**

    cd ~/
    git clone git@github.com:ofridagan/tutijs.git

**install dependencies**

	cd tutijs
    sudo npm install

## Running

**Running development server**
The development server runs on your machine and serves the project your are about to write

    npm run start
  Your default browser should open at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and you should see the app there

## What's next?

Open your favorite text editor, locate the first chapter at **src/chapters/1_introduction.js**.
Follow the instruction there.

### Good Luck <3 ###
